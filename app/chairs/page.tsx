            <p>Greetings Esteemed Delegates,</p>
            <p>
              It is my honour and privilege to welcome you to the Disarmament
              and International Security Committee (DISEC) at VCEMUN 2025. As
              one of the principal organs of the United Nations General
              Assembly, DISEC plays a vital role in addressing global security
              challenges, promoting disarmament, and preventing the
              proliferation of weapons that threaten peace and stability.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, we gather to deliberate on one of the most pressing
              threats to international security—the use of chemical and
              biological weapons in conflict. These weapons, capable of causing
              widespread destruction and suffering, violate international
              humanitarian law and undermine global efforts toward peace. While
              significant strides have been made through international treaties,
              recent events have demonstrated the persistent threat posed by
              both state and non-state actors in acquiring and deploying these
              weapons. It is now our responsibility to reinforce existing
              frameworks, enhance compliance mechanisms, and explore innovative
              solutions to mitigate this danger.
            </p>
            <p>
              At VCEMUN, we strive to create a space for dynamic discourse,
              critical thinking, and meaningful diplomacy. Whether you are a
              seasoned delegate or stepping into committee for the first time, I
              encourage you to engage with confidence, challenge perspectives,
              and collaborate toward viable resolutions. The discussions we have
              here will not only shape committee outcomes but also refine our
              collective understanding of global security issues. I look forward
              to witnessing your insights, debates, and solutions over the
              course of the conference. Let us work together to pave the way for
              a safer and more secure world.

              It is my distinct honour and privilege to welcome you to the
              Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) at VCEMUN 2025. As one of the

              critical and pressing global challenge—Combating Illicit Trading
              and Wildlife Resource Trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Illicit wildlife trade is one of the largest and most profitable
              transnational crimes, fuelling environmental destruction, species
              extinction, and organized criminal networks. Beyond its
              devastating impact on biodiversity, this illegal industry
              threatens global security, economic stability, and the livelihoods
              of communities that depend on sustainable ecosystems. As
              delegates, you will be tasked with formulating innovative and
              actionable solutions to dismantle trafficking networks, strengthen
              enforcement mechanisms, and promote sustainable alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              At VCEMUN, we aim to foster an intellectually stimulating and
              collaborative environment where delegates of all experience levels
              can engage meaningfully in diplomacy and problem-solving. Whether
              you are a first-time participant or a seasoned MUN veteran, your
              contributions will be instrumental in shaping discussions that
              lead to effective policy recommendations. I encourage you to
              research thoroughly, debate passionately, and negotiate
              strategically as we work towards pragmatic solutions that balance
              conservation efforts with economic and social realities.
            </p>

              This committee promises to challenge your perspectives, sharpen
